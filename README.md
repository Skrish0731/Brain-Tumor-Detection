# Brain-Tumor-Detection
This Project is mainly built to help doctors finding brain tumor detection using MRI scan of brain. At first we train the model with a set of MRI scan images with and without having tumor to train the model and it learns how to differentiate using several libraries.

The project is built on Kaggle and the source code with output can be seen at Kaggle.

To run this projecr on kaggle, the project needs to be imported on the kaggle platform and make path changes to dataset accordingly. Omce the prject is imported click on the run all button or run each piece of code individually by clicking the run button beside each piece of code. Once the project is successfully launched, the console which will be at the bottom of the screen will give the output showing up the images with brain tumor and the accuracy of the model which is built.

Also this project can be run on google colab using the same way as kaggle.
